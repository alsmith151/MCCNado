# Hybridisation (120 bp oligo from chatGPT so use with cation):

General Guidelines for 120 bp Oligo Hybridization:
Minimum Matches for Stable Hybridization:

With a 120 bp oligo, 30-40 consecutive base pair matches can be sufficient for stable hybridization under standard conditions (e.g., 50-60°C, normal salt concentrations). This is because longer oligos naturally provide higher specificity due to their length.
At least 30-40 bases of complementary sequence should be enough to ensure specific binding, but the actual number can be adjusted depending on GC content and desired stringency.
GC Content:

For optimal stability, aim for a GC content of 40-60%. Since GC pairs are more stable (due to their three hydrogen bonds), fewer consecutive matches might be needed if the region with matching bases is GC-rich.
For regions with higher AT content, you may need more consecutive matches (closer to 40 or more) to ensure stable hybridization.
Stringency of Hybridization Conditions:

High-stringency conditions (higher temperature, lower salt) require more complementary matches for stable hybridization. If you're working under high stringency, you might need 40-50 consecutive matching bases.
Low-stringency conditions (lower temperature, higher salt) could allow stable hybridization with 25-30 consecutive matching bases, but this risks non-specific binding.
Melting Temperature (Tm):

The melting temperature (Tm) is a critical factor. With a 120 bp oligo, you'd want a Tm within a reasonable range for the assay you're performing (typically 50-65°C).
The Tm can be estimated using nearest-neighbor thermodynamics for longer oligos. Make sure the hybridization conditions allow the oligo to form a stable duplex with the target based on Tm.
Specific Applications:
Long probe hybridization (e.g., FISH, microarrays): For a 120 bp probe, you generally need 30-50 consecutive matching bases to ensure stable and specific hybridization.
Capture probes or long DNA hybridization probes (e.g., Southern blot): Similarly, 30-50 matches should be sufficient.
Summary:
For a 120 bp oligonucleotide, a minimum of 30-40 consecutive matches is generally needed to ensure stable and specific hybridization under standard conditions. If the GC content is high or hybridization conditions are less stringent, fewer matches may be sufficient (around 30), but higher stringency conditions will require closer to 40-50 matching bases.



## KAPA protocol (pg 24)

Chapter 5. Hybridize the Sample to KAPA Target Enrichment Probes
1. Prepare the Hybridization Master Mix following the tables below according to the capture target size.
a. For a KAPA Target Enrichment design < 40 Mbp in capture target size, prepare a master mix of the following reagents:
< 40 Mbp Capture Target Size –
Hybridization Master Mix Per Individual Capture
Hybridization Buffer 28 μL
Hybridization Component H 12 μL
PCR Grade water 3 μL
Total 43 μL
b. For a KAPA Target Enrichment design ≥ 40 Mbp in capture target size, prepare a master mix of the following reagents:
≥ 40 Mbp Capture Target Size –
Hybridization Master Mix Per Individual Capture
Hybridization Buffer 28 μL
Hybridization Component H 9 μL
PCR Grade water 6 μL
Total 43 μL
2. Add 43 µL of the Hybridization Master Mix to the bead-bound DNA mixture resuspended in Universal Enhancing Oligos.
3. Mix thoroughly and perform a quick spin. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.
4. Place the sample on the magnet to collect the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.
5. Transfer 56.4 µL of the eluate (entire volume) into a new tube/well containing 4 µL of the KAPA Target Enrichment Probe.
Slight bead carryover may be observed when transferring the supernatant.
This is unlikely to impact results.
6. Mix thoroughly by vortexing for 10 seconds and perform a quick spin.
7. Perform the hybridization incubation in a thermocycler using the following program with the lid temperature set to +105°C:
• +95°C for 5 minutes
• +55°C for 16 to 20 hours
The sample must remain at +55°C until it is transferred to the Capture Beads in Chapter 6.
